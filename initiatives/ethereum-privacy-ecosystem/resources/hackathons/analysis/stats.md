### Quick Headline Numbers & Averages

| Metric                                      | Value      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Total Hackathons                            | 31         |
| Total Hackahtons (with privacy submissions) | 23         |
| Total Hackers                               | 10,357     |
| Average Hackers per Hackahton               | 357        |
| Total Projects                              | 4,290      |
| Average Submission per Hackathon            | 138        |
| Total Privacy Projects                      | 308        |
| Privacy Submission Ratio                    | 7.18%      |
| Average Privacy Submissions per Hackathon   | 13         |
| Average Price Pool                          | $120,056   |
| Median Prize Pool                           | $40,425    |
| Total Prize Money                           | $3,601,683 |

### Correlation Chart Between Submissions and Prize Pool

<img width="3336" height="990" alt="top10privacy submissions vs prize pools" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6feebb13-86f2-4ecf-bd04-240e79eece5c" />

> **NOTE:** *Events with $200K–$275K prize pools (ETHGlobal New Delhi, ETHGlobal Cannes, ETHGlobal New York) have 14–42 submissions with moderate correlation in mid-range. Very small prize pools ($2K–$10K) almost always have 0–1 submissions. Extremely large prize pools do not guarantee high privacy participation. Prize size alone is not a strong driver for privacy submissions.

### IRL vs. Virtual Hackathon Comparison

| Type    | Hackathons | Total Prize ($) | Total Submissions | Privacy Submissions | % Privacy Submissions |   Avg. Prize Pool | Avg. Hackers (non-missing) |
| ------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| IRL     |         28 |      $2,776,683 |             2,695 |                 234 |             **8.68%** | $102,840.11       |                     258.41 |
| Virtual |          3 |        $825,000 |             1,595 |                  76 |             **4.76%** | $275,000.00       |                   1,690.00 |

> **NOTE:** *IRL hackathons have a higher proportion of privacy submissions (8.68%) than Virtual events (4.76%) in this dataset.*

### TOP 10 Hackathons Ranked by Privacy Intensity

| Rank | Event                | Privacy Subms. | Total Subms. | Privacy intensity (%) |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
|    1 | **ETHBelgrade**      |             10 |           20 |            **50.00%** |
|    2 | **ETHTokyo**         |             19 |           41 |            **46.34%** |
|    3 | **ETHDam**           |             13 |           33 |            **39.39%** |
|    4 | **ETHRome**          |             23 |           65 |            **35.38%** |
|    5 | **ETHWarsaw**        |              8 |           42 |            **19.05%** |
|    6 | **ETHGlobal Prague** |             29 |          223 |            **13.00%** |
|    7 | **ETHAccra**         |              5 |           39 |            **12.82%** |
|    8 | **ETHGlobal Cannes** |             35 |          343 |            **10.20%** |
|    9 | **ETHDublin**        |              3 |           31 |             **9.68%** |
|   10 | **ETHIstanbul**      |              4 |           42 |             **9.52%** |

> **NOTE:** *A few events (notably ETHBelgrade and ETHTokyo) show extremely high privacy intensity — in Belgrade 50% of submissions were privacy-related (though total submissions there was only 20). Larger hackathons (e.g.: ETHGlobal Prague, ETHGlobal Cannes, ETHGlobal New Delhi, and ETHGlobal ETHOnline) produce many privacy projects in absolute numbers but are lower on intensity % because they have many non-privacy projects.*

> **NOTE:** *"ZK" (zero-knowledge) is the single most frequent token by far, followed by "AI" and "proofs", confirming heavy focus on zero-knowledge proofs and AI across project descriptions. Words related to privacy and confidentiality (preserving, encrypted, confidential, anonymous, private-related tokens) are common. Finance/DeFi vocabulary (defi, payments, token, ethereum, bridge/cross) also appears frequently. "chain", "blockchain", "protocol", "platform", and "wallet" indicate infrastructural or plumbing projects.*

> **NOTE:** *Counts are derived from regex-based detection across project descriptions. "**Total Occurrences**" counts all matches; "**Projects with Keyword**" counts distinct projects whose description mentions the keyword at least once. Regex-based matching was used for each target with some common variants (e.g., 'zk', 'zero-knowledge' and 'zero knowledge', 'encrypted', 'encrypt', 'fhe' and 'fully homomorphic', 'mpc' and 'multi-party', 'tee' includes 'trusted execution', 'nitro', 'tdx', 'secure enclave', etc.).*
