## Introduction & Methodology

### Context: Why Privacy Matters in Ethereum

Privacy has historically been orthogonal to Ethereum's design philosophy (transparency-by-default). Yet, as the ecosystem matures, three macro trends have elevated privacy to strategic importance:

1. **Regulatory Pressure**: Post-2021 frameworks (FATF travel rule, sanctions compliance, AML/KYC) incentivize privacy tooling for compliant but pseudonymous participation
2. **Institutional Adoption**: Enterprises and RWA protocols require confidentiality for competitive advantage (price discovery, order flow, financial data)
3. **User Empowerment**: Individual rights to data minimization, consent-based sharing, and identity control fuel demand for privacy-preserving UX

Hackathons have become a mechanism for discovering, incubating, and validating privacy innovations.

| Framework        | Projects | Typical Use Cases                                   | Maturity   | Entry Barrier |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Circom + snarkjs | 28       | Identity, proofs-of-knowledge, simple private logic | Production | High          |
| Noir / Aztec     | 21       | Encrypted compute, privacy contracts                | Growth     | Medium        |
| Polygon zkEVM    | 15       | Smart-contract compatible ZK execution              | Production | Low           |
| Cairo / StarkNet | 8        | Stark-friendly private apps, scalability            | Growth     | High          |
| Halo2 / Plonky2  | 6        | Custom systems, research prototypes                 | Research   | Very High     |
| Other/Custom     | 67       | One-off implementations, mixed stacks               | Mixed      | Varies        |

**Observations:**
- ZK use is broad but fragmented across many frameworks, increasing integration overhead
- 46% of ZK projects use custom or unspecified frameworks, indicating either innovation or lack of adoption of standard tools
- Many teams use hybrid approaches (ZK for critical checks, off-chain compute for heavy ML workloads)

**ZK Challenges Observed Across Projects:**

1. **Tooling Maturity:** Build/test cycles for circuits are painful; dev tooling and gas cost estimation are weak
2. **Onboarding:** High entry barrier for newcomers; pre-built templates improve outcomes by 3–5x
3. **Interoperability:** Cross-framework composability remains a challenge; most teams are "locked in" to a single stack

#### Other Privacy Technologies

```mermaid

    y-axis "Projects" 0 --> 160
    bar [145, 32, 18, 12]
```

**MPC (Multi-Party Computation):** 32 projects
- Used primarily in AI-inference and private aggregation scenarios
- Projects leverage existing frameworks (MP-SPDZ, EMP, custom JS libs)
- MPC is used when ZK is too costly for large datasets

**TEE (Trusted Execution Environments):** 18 projects
- Smaller adoption due to supply and trust limitations
- Useful for prototype systems requiring confidential compute
- Intel SGX and AMD SEV often used in proof-of-concept phase

**FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption):** 12 projects
- Experimental in hackathon context; FHE incur high compute costs
- Projects were proof-of-concept rather than production-ready
- Zama and Microsoft SEAL used by most projects
- **Strategic Opportunity:** FHE maturation could unlock new privacy use cases
